# Predicting-Influencers-in-Social-Network
Machine Learning Model that predicts the most influencing person among other users of Instagram using different Machine Learning models such as SVM, Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, MLP and Random Forest. Performed Feature Extraction, Normalization, and Cross-Validation and used Ensemble Stacking Model upon the machine learning models and achieved 89% accuracy.

README
Inorder to execute the project “Predicting Influencers in Social Network”, follow the below instructions and requirements are

Software Requirements: 
Programming Language : Python 3.6

Instructions:
Step 1 : Install any Python IDE, we used SPYDER(IDE) of Anaconda3.
Step 2 : Download the influencers dataset from Kaggle Repository.
Step 3 : Open the predict.py and influencers.py files from SPYDER IDE present in the code folder.
Step 4 : Execute the predict.py file.
Step 5 : A pop up GUI window is generated. Click on the function buttons aligned in the window and the most influencing person is predicted.
